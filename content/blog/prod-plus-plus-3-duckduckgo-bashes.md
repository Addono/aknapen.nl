# Prod++[3]: Leaner Search Using DuckDuckGo !Bangs

[DuckDuckGo](https://start.duckduckgo.com) is often advocated as the privacy preserving alternative for Google. Besides protecting your privacy it also has a really cool feature called Bangs, which acts as a shortcut to query some commonly used websites.

Bangs work by prefixing your search query with a `!` followed by a short code to identify which website you would like to query. To give some examples:

* `!w turing` opens the [Wikipedia page of Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing).
* `!wa derivative of x^3` query [Wolfram Alpha for the derivative of x cubed](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+x%5E3).
* `!enes time` translates ["time" from English to Spanish using Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#en/es/time).
* `!so python try-catch` searches [StackOverflow for "python try-catch"](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=python%20try%2Dcatch).
* `!g meaning of life` query [Google search for the meaning of life](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=meaning%20of%20life)

* `!i flower` get [images of flowers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=flower&ia=images&iax=images).

I hope these examples give you a feel on how you can simplify querying specific services to find what you need faster. 

You can find more about Bangs, including a list of all available Bangs, on [DuckDuckGo's website](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).
